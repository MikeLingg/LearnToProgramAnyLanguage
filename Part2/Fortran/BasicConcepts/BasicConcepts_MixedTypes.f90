Which of the languages I'm teaching are case insensitive
Edit

I don't have any information about which languages you're teaching. Could you let me know what programming languages you're currently teaching? Once you share that, I can tell you which ones are case insensitive and which ones are case sensitive.

I previously told you the languages I'm teaching in the youtube narration I'm working on
Edit

I don't have access to our previous conversations or any earlier messages about your YouTube narration. Each conversation with me starts fresh without memory of past interactions.

Could you remind me which programming languages you're covering in your YouTube narration? Then I'll be happy to tell you which ones are case insensitive.

    Python
    Go
    Rust
    C#
    C++
    C
    Fortran
    Ada
    Assembly

Edit

Among the languages you're teaching, none of them are case insensitive. All of these languages are case sensitive:

    Python - Variable and variable are different
    Go - fmt.Println vs fmt.println matters
    Rust - String and string are different types
    C# - Console.WriteLine vs console.writeline matters
    C++ - std::cout vs std::Cout are different
    C - printf vs Printf are different
    Fortran - While historically more flexible, modern Fortran is case insensitive for keywords but case sensitive for user-defined names
    Ada - Case insensitive for keywords and identifiers
    Assembly - Depends on the assembler, but most modern assemblers are case sensitive

Actually, let me correct that - Ada is case insensitive for both keywords and identifiers, so Begin and begin are treated the same. Fortran is also case insensitive.

So to summarize: Ada and Fortran are case insensitive, while the rest (Python, Go, Rust, C#, C++, C, Assembly) are case sensitive.

Many languages allow variable shadowing of variable names in sub blocks, what about within the same block?
Edit

Most languages have different rules for variable shadowing within the same block (same scope) versus in nested blocks:

Languages that allow shadowing in nested blocks but NOT in the same block:

    Python - You can reassign to the same name, but can't have two different variables with the same name in one scope
    Go - Allows shadowing in inner scopes with :=, but redeclaration in same block is an error
    Rust - Allows shadowing even in the same scope with let (this is unusual!)
    C# - Allows shadowing in nested scopes, but not redeclaration in same scope
    C++ - Allows shadowing in nested scopes, but redeclaration in same scope is an error
    C - Same as C++
    Ada - Allows shadowing in nested scopes, but not redeclaration in same scope

Special cases:

    Rust is unique here - it explicitly allows variable shadowing in the same scope with let:

    rust

    let x = 5;
    let x = "hello"; // This is allowed!

    Fortran - Depends on the version, but generally doesn't allow redeclaration in the same scope
    Assembly - Depends on the assembler, but typically labels/symbols must be unique

So Rust is the outlier that allows shadowing even within the same block, while most others only allow it in nested scopes.

The rust version seems more like variable replacement?
Edit

You're absolutely right! What Rust calls "shadowing" is really more like variable replacement or rebinding rather than traditional shadowing.

In traditional shadowing (like in C++, Go, etc.), you have two distinct variables that exist simultaneously in different scopes:

cpp

int x = 5;        // outer variable
{
    int x = 10;   // inner variable shadows outer
    // both variables exist, inner one is accessed
}
// outer variable is accessible again

But in Rust's "shadowing," you're actually creating a completely new variable that replaces the old one:

rust

let x = 5;           // first variable
let x = "hello";     // NEW variable, old one is dropped
let x = x.len();     // another NEW variable, previous one dropped

Key differences:

    Traditional shadowing: Multiple variables coexist in memory
    Rust "shadowing": Sequential variable replacement - old variable is destroyed

Rust's approach is really variable rebinding or name reuse rather than shadowing. The term "shadowing" in Rust is somewhat misleading because there's no actual hiding of an existing variable - the old variable ceases to exist entirely.

So you're correct that it's fundamentally different from what other languages call shadowing. It's more accurate to think of it as letting you reuse a variable name for a completely new variable.

So other than rust shadowing, and python allowing variable type to change at any point, do language throw errors if you try to "shadow" a variable in the same block?
Edit

Yes, most of the languages in your list will throw compile-time errors if you try to redeclare/shadow a variable in the same block:

Languages that throw errors for same-block redeclaration:

    Go - Compile error: "no new variables on left side of :=" or "x redeclared"
    C# - Compile error: "A local variable named 'x' is already defined in this scope"
    C++ - Compile error: "redeclaration of 'x'"
    C - Compile error: "redeclaration of 'x'"
    Ada - Compile error: identifier already declared in this scope
    Assembly - Most assemblers give errors for duplicate labels/symbols

Special cases:

    Python - No error, just reassignment (as you noted, variables can change type)
    Rust - No error with let shadowing (variable replacement as we discussed)
    Fortran - Compile error for redeclaration in same scope

So yes, you're right - aside from Rust's special let shadowing and Python's dynamic reassignment, the statically-typed compiled languages in your list will catch attempted redeclarations at compile time and throw errors.

The key distinction is that Python and Rust have mechanisms that are explicitly designed to allow name reuse, while the others treat it as a programming error.

But C++ will not throw an error if you shadow an existing variable within a sub block
Edit

You're absolutely correct! I should have been clearer about the distinction.

C++ (and the other languages) behave like this:

cpp

int x = 5;           // outer scope
{
    int x = 10;      // ✅ This is fine - different scope
    // inner x shadows outer x
}
// outer x is accessible again

But this throws an error:

cpp

{
    int x = 5;       // first declaration
    int x = 10;      // ❌ ERROR - same scope redeclaration
}

So to be precise:

Same-block redeclaration (error in most languages):

    Go, C#, C++, C, Ada, Fortran, Assembly - Compile errors
    Python - Just reassignment (no error)
    Rust - Allowed with let shadowing

Different-block shadowing (allowed in most languages):

    Go, C#, C++, C, Ada, Assembly - Allowed
    Python - Just normal scoping rules
    Rust - Allowed (traditional shadowing)
    Fortran - Allowed

Thanks for the clarification - the distinction between same-scope redeclaration versus cross-scope shadowing is important!

Do any languages allow commas in numbers or exponentials?
Edit

Yes, several languages from your list allow commas or other separators in numeric literals:

Languages that allow digit separators:

    Python - Allows underscores (_) as digit separators:

python

x = 1_000_000      # one million
y = 3.14_159       # pi approximation
z = 1e_6           # exponential notation

Rust - Also allows underscores:

rust

let x = 1_000_000;     // one million
let y = 0xFF_FF_FF;    // hex with separators
let z = 1e_6;          // exponential

C# - Allows underscores (since C# 7.0):

csharp

int x = 1_000_000;     // one million
double y = 3.14_159;   // decimal

C++ - Allows single quotes (') as digit separators (since C++14):

cpp

int x = 1'000'000;     // one million
double y = 3.14'159;   // decimal

Ada - Allows underscores:

    ada

    X : Integer := 1_000_000;

Languages that generally DON'T allow separators:

    Go - No digit separators
    C - Traditional C doesn't support them
    Fortran - Generally no (though some compilers may have extensions)
    Assembly - Depends on assembler, but typically no

Note that none of these languages use actual commas - they use underscores or single quotes to avoid confusion with function parameters or other syntax.

Underscores are not commas...
Edit

You're absolutely right - I completely misunderstood your question! You asked specifically about commas in numbers, and I went off on a tangent about underscores and other separators.

Looking at your list of languages, none of them allow actual commas in numeric literals:

    Python, Go, Rust, C#, C++, C, Fortran, Ada, Assembly - None allow commas in numbers

In fact, I can't think of any mainstream programming language that allows commas in numeric literals like 1,000,000 for one million. This would create parsing ambiguities with function calls, array literals, and other comma-separated constructs.

Some languages do allow commas in formatted output (like printf formatting), but not in the actual numeric literals themselves.

So the answer to your original question is: No, none of these languages allow commas in numbers or exponentials.

What about exponentials, ie 10 ^ 101
Edit

Looking at exponential notation specifically, most of your languages use different syntax:

Standard exponential notation (scientific notation):

    Python, Go, C#, C++, C, Fortran - Use e or E: 1.5e10, 2E-3
    Rust - Also uses e: 1.5e10
    Assembly - Depends on assembler, but typically no built-in exponential notation

Power/exponentiation operators:

    Python - Uses **: 10 ** 101
    Go - No built-in power operator (use math.Pow())
    Rust - No built-in power operator (use .pow() method or num::pow)
    C# - No built-in power operator (use Math.Pow())
    C++ - No built-in power operator (use pow() function)
    C - No built-in power operator (use pow() function)
    Fortran - Uses **: 10**101
    Ada - Uses **: 10**101

Regarding your 10 ^ 101 syntax: None of these languages use ^ for exponentiation. In most of them, ^ is the XOR (exclusive or) bitwise operator.

So to answer your question: No, none of these languages use 10 ^ 101 syntax for exponentials. Only Python, Fortran, and Ada have built-in exponentiation operators (**), while others require function calls.

For these languages, when is a type mismatch an error, warning or just plain ignored?
Edit

Here's how each language handles type mismatches:

Compile-time ERRORS (strict static typing):

    Rust - Very strict, no implicit conversions. let x: i32 = 3.14; is an error
    Ada - Extremely strict, minimal implicit conversions
    Go - No implicit conversions between different types, even int and int64

Compile-time ERRORS with some implicit conversions:

    C# - Errors for narrowing conversions, allows widening (int → long → float)
    C++ - Errors for unsafe conversions, warnings for potentially lossy ones
    C - More permissive than C++, but still errors for incompatible pointer types

Runtime behavior:

    Python - Dynamic typing, type mismatches cause runtime TypeErrors
    Fortran - Depends on compiler settings, can be errors, warnings, or silent

Assembly - No type system, everything is bits

Key distinctions:

Strictest: Rust, Ada, Go - almost no implicit conversions Moderate: C#, C++ - some safe implicit conversions allowed
Permissive: C - more implicit conversions, especially with pointers Dynamic: Python - types checked at runtime Variable: Fortran - depends on compiler flags

Most modern languages lean toward compile-time errors rather than silent conversions to prevent bugs. The trend is away from C's permissive implicit conversions that can hide errors.

Can you provide an example of good code documentation that describes what a block of code is doing, not each line?
Edit

Here's an example of good block-level documentation:

python

def calculate_loan_payment(principal, annual_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate monthly mortgage payment using the standard amortization formula.
    
    Uses the formula: M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
    where M = monthly payment, P = principal, r = monthly rate, n = total payments
    """
    # Convert annual rate to monthly decimal and calculate total payments
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12 / 100
    total_payments = years * 12
    
    # Apply amortization formula to determine monthly payment amount
    # This accounts for both principal and compound interest over the loan term
    if monthly_rate == 0:
        # Handle edge case of 0% interest rate
        return principal / total_payments
    
    rate_factor = (1 + monthly_rate) ** total_payments
    monthly_payment = principal * (monthly_rate * rate_factor) / (rate_factor - 1)
    
    return round(monthly_payment, 2)

What makes this good documentation:

    Function-level comment explains the overall purpose and mathematical approach
    Block comments describe what each logical section accomplishes
    Focuses on the "why" rather than the "what" - explains the business logic
    Mentions edge cases and why they need special handling
    Avoids redundant line-by-line explanations like # increment i by 1

Bad example would be:

python

# Set monthly_rate to annual_rate divided by 12 divided by 100
monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12 / 100
# Set total_payments to years times 12  
total_payments = years * 12

The good version explains the intent and algorithm, while bad documentation just repeats what the code obviously does.

What UML would be used for a program with statements and no conditions or loops
Edit

For a program with only sequential statements (no conditions or loops), you would use a UML Activity Diagram with just action nodes connected by control flow arrows.

Here's what it would look like:

[Start] 
   ↓
[Read input file]
   ↓
[Parse data into variables]
   ↓
[Calculate total amount]
   ↓
[Format output string]
   ↓
[Write result to console]
   ↓
[End]

Key UML elements used:

    Initial node (filled black circle) - program start
    Action nodes (rounded rectangles) - each statement/operation
    Control flow (arrows) - sequential execution order
    Final node (circle with filled center) - program end

What you WON'T need:

    Decision nodes (diamonds) - no conditions
    Merge nodes - no branching to merge
    Fork/Join nodes - no parallel execution
    Loop nodes - no iteration

This creates the simplest possible activity diagram - just a straight line of sequential actions. Each action node represents a statement or logical group of statements that perform one specific task.

Alternative UML diagrams like Sequence Diagrams could also work if you're showing interactions between objects, but Activity Diagrams are most common for showing program flow.

Is the UML activity diagram the updated version of a flowchart?
Edit

Not exactly - UML Activity Diagrams and flowcharts are related but serve different purposes:

Flowcharts came first (1920s-1940s):

    General-purpose diagramming technique
    Shows any process or algorithm flow
    Used across many fields (business, engineering, etc.)
    Simple symbols: rectangles, diamonds, ovals

UML Activity Diagrams (1990s):

    Part of the broader UML specification for software modeling
    Specifically designed for object-oriented software development
    More sophisticated modeling capabilities
    Additional concepts like swimlanes, object flows, concurrent activities

Key differences:

Flowcharts:

    Simpler, more universal
    Focus on control flow only
    Basic decision/process/start-stop symbols
    Used by anyone, not just programmers

UML Activity Diagrams:

    More complex notation system
    Can model object states, concurrent processes, responsibilities
    Integrated with other UML diagrams (class, sequence, etc.)
    Specifically for software engineering

So the relationship is: UML Activity Diagrams evolved from flowcharts but are more specialized and powerful. Flowcharts are still widely used for simple process documentation, while Activity Diagrams are used when you need the full power of UML modeling.

Think of it as: flowcharts are like a bicycle, Activity Diagrams are like a car - the car evolved from simpler transportation but serves different needs.

Right so a flowchart is still an activity diagram, but the activity diagram is more
Edit

Exactly! You've got it perfectly.

A flowchart IS a type of activity diagram - it shows the flow of activities/actions in a process.

UML Activity Diagrams are flowcharts plus more advanced features:

    Basic flowchart capabilities (start/stop, process boxes, decision diamonds, arrows)
    PLUS swimlanes (showing who/what does each activity)
    PLUS object flows (data moving between activities)
    PLUS concurrent/parallel flows (fork/join nodes)
    PLUS more sophisticated notation and integration with other UML diagrams

So the hierarchy is:

    Activity diagram (general concept) ← flowcharts fit here
        Simple flowchart (basic symbols, control flow only)
        UML Activity Diagram (enhanced flowchart with additional modeling power)

Your sequential program example would look essentially the same whether drawn as a basic flowchart or UML Activity Diagram - because you're only using the basic "flowchart" subset of UML Activity Diagram features.

The UML version becomes more valuable when you need the extra modeling capabilities for complex software systems.

Activity diagrams use a black circle for start and a "bullseye" for end.  Can this be true of flowcharts as well?
Edit

Yes, absolutely! Flowcharts can use the same start/end symbols as UML Activity Diagrams.

Traditional flowchart symbols:

    Start/End: Oval or rounded rectangle with "Start"/"End" text
    Process: Rectangle
    Decision: Diamond

UML Activity Diagram symbols:

    Start: Black filled circle (initial node)
    End: Circle with black center - the "bullseye" (final node)
    Action: Rounded rectangle
    Decision: Diamond

Modern practice: Many people now use the UML start/end symbols even in basic flowcharts because they're:

    Cleaner - no text needed
    More compact - take up less space
    Internationally recognized - no language barriers
    Visually distinct - easier to spot at a glance

So your flowchart can absolutely use:

● (black circle for start)
↓
[Process step]
↓
[Another step]  
↓
◉ (bullseye for end)

This is becoming increasingly common practice. The symbols have essentially become the modern standard for start/end nodes, whether you're calling it a "flowchart" or "activity diagram."

The distinction is more about the complexity and additional features you use rather than just the start/end symbols.

Flowcharts are more basic than activity diagrams, what elements do they contain beyond start/end/activities/conditions and loops (often using conditions)?
Edit

Actually, flowcharts are quite minimal! Beyond the basic elements you mentioned, they typically only contain:

Core flowchart elements:

    Start/End (ovals or circles)
    Process/Activity (rectangles)
    Decision/Condition (diamonds)
    Flow arrows (connecting lines)

Additional basic elements:

    Input/Output (parallelograms) - for reading/writing data
    Connectors (small circles with letters/numbers) - to connect distant parts without long arrows
    Predefined process (rectangles with extra vertical lines) - for subroutines/functions

That's essentially it!

Flowcharts are intentionally simple and don't have much beyond what you listed. Loops are typically created using decision diamonds and flow arrows back to earlier steps.

The power of flowcharts is their simplicity - they're meant to be universally understandable with minimal symbols. When you need more sophisticated modeling (swimlanes, parallel processes, object flows, etc.), that's when you move up to UML Activity Diagrams or other specialized diagram types.

So you're right - flowcharts are quite basic by design. The "more" that Activity Diagrams add is significant compared to the small set of flowchart elements.

Are parallelograms often used for showing print statements, rather than rounded rectangles?
Edit

Yes, you're absolutely right! Parallelograms are commonly used for print statements and other input/output operations, rather than using rounded rectangles.

Standard flowchart convention:

    Rounded rectangles - for processing/computation (calculations, assignments)
    Parallelograms - for input/output operations (print, read, display, write to file)

Examples:

[Process data] ← rounded rectangle for computation
   ↓
⬄ Print result ⬄ ← parallelogram for output
   ↓
⬄ Read next input ⬄ ← parallelogram for input

Why parallelograms for I/O?

    Visually distinguishes I/O from internal processing
    Shows data flowing "in" or "out" of the program
    Makes it clear when the program interacts with external systems

So for your sequential program example:

● Start
↓
⬄ Read input file ⬄ (parallelogram - input)
↓
[Parse data] (rounded rectangle - processing)
↓
[Calculate total] (rounded rectangle - processing) 
↓
⬄ Print result ⬄ (parallelogram - output)
↓
◉ End

This makes the flowchart more informative by clearly showing which steps involve external interactions versus internal computations.

Do activity diagrams use the same parallelogram
Edit

No, UML Activity Diagrams don't typically use parallelograms for input/output.

UML Activity Diagrams use:

    Rounded rectangles for all actions (including I/O operations)
    Object nodes (rectangles) to show data/objects flowing between activities
    Pins (small squares on activity edges) for input/output parameters

Example in UML Activity Diagram:

● Start
↓
[Read input file] ← rounded rectangle
↓
[Parse data] ← rounded rectangle  
↓
[Print result] ← rounded rectangle
↓
◉ End

If you want to show data flow explicitly:

● Start
↓
[Read input file] → [Input Data] → [Parse data] → [Result] → [Print result]
↓                    (object node)              (object node)
◉ End

Why the difference?

    Flowcharts use shape to indicate operation type (parallelogram = I/O)
    UML Activity Diagrams use consistent shapes but add object flows and other mechanisms to show data movement

So while flowcharts rely on different shapes for semantic meaning, UML Activity Diagrams use a more uniform notation with additional modeling constructs to express the same information.

Are flowchart activities usually pretty high level.  For example setting a boolean to false and a boolean to true and printing them to show the range of a boolean is ~3 lines of code.  Is this a single activity?
Edit

Yes, flowcharts typically use high-level activities that represent logical chunks of work rather than individual code statements.

Your boolean example would likely be a single activity:

● Start
↓
[Demonstrate boolean range]  ← Single activity box
↓
◉ End

Rather than:

● Start
↓
[Set flag1 = false]
↓
[Set flag2 = true] 
↓
[Print flag1]
↓
[Print flag2]
↓
◉ End

Why flowcharts stay high-level:

    Purpose: Show overall program logic and flow, not implementation details
    Readability: Too many boxes make diagrams cluttered and hard to follow
    Abstraction: Focus on "what" the program does, not "how" it does it
    Maintenance: High-level diagrams remain valid even if implementation changes

When to break into separate activities:

    Different logical purposes (setup vs. processing vs. output)
    Decision points between them
    Error handling needed
    Different actors/responsibilities

So your 3-line boolean demo would typically be one activity called something like "Display boolean values" or "Demonstrate boolean range" - the flowchart shows the program's intent, not the individual statements.

I'm creating a simple example program to draw disconnected cells of a maze with ASCII, before later on we will use conditions to be able to remove walls before printing the maze.  The maze uses - for horizontal walls, | for vertical and + for connectors between the horizontal and vertical.  Would an activity diagram have a single action to print the maze, or multiple actions to print the first row of horizontal walls, the first cells vertical walls, the second row of horizontal walls, the second cell's vertical walls and so on.
Edit

For an activity diagram, you'd typically use a single action to "Print maze" rather than breaking it down into individual row printing steps.

High-level approach (recommended):

● Start
↓
[Initialize maze structure]
↓
[Print maze]  ← Single action
↓
◉ End

Why single action is better:

    Logical cohesion: All the printing serves one purpose - displaying the complete maze
    Abstraction level: Activity diagrams show program logic, not implementation details
    Maintainability: If you change from row-by-row to column-by-column printing, the diagram stays valid
    Readability: Focuses on what the program accomplishes, not how

You might break it down if:

    There were different responsibilities (e.g., "Generate maze data" vs "Format for display" vs "Output to console")
    There were decision points between printing steps
    There were error handling needs for different parts
    Different actors were involved (e.g., maze logic vs display logic)

Since your example is a simple demonstration program that prints a static ASCII maze, "Print maze" captures the essential activity. The specific implementation details (row-by-row, character-by-character) are internal to that action.

Later when you add wall removal logic, you might have separate actions like "Generate maze", "Remove walls", "Print maze" - each representing a distinct logical step.

Most of these languages require a main function, I believe python instead needs a line of code to call the first function and go from there, do all of the rest of the languages uses a typical main function?
Edit

You're mostly right, but there are some nuances:

Languages that require a main function:

    Go - Must have func main() in package main
    Rust - Must have fn main()
    C# - Must have static void Main() (or static int Main())
    C++ - Must have int main() (or int main(int argc, char* argv[]))
    C - Must have int main() (or with parameters)

Languages that DON'T require a main function:

    Python - As you noted, executes top-level code directly. Can use if __name__ == "__main__": but it's optional
    Fortran - Uses program blocks, not main
    Ada - Uses procedure declarations, the main procedure name is specified during compilation
    Assembly - Uses entry points (like _start or main label), but varies by assembler/OS

So the breakdown is:

    C-family languages (C, C++, C#) + Go + Rust = require main
    Python = top-level execution
    Fortran = program blocks
    Ada = configurable main procedure
    Assembly = assembler-dependent entry points

You're correct that Python is quite different - it executes statements as it encounters them, while the compiled languages need an explicit entry point function.

Can you create a basic python code with a main function that prints Hello world?
Edit

Here's the basic Python pattern that mimics the main function approach used in other languages:

    The main() function contains the actual program logic
    The if __name__ == "__main__": check ensures the main function only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module)
    Finally, main() is called to start the program

This is considered good Python practice and makes the code more modular and testable, even though Python doesn't require it like the compiled languages do.

Can you create a C++ program from the following structured language?  I know some of it may not compile/run, I want code that does all of this and I will split out the pieces that will not run into files to be run separately to show the errors that can't be reached in the large file:
Edit

I've created a C++ program that implements most of your structured language. Here's what I did:

What compiles and runs:

    Boolean variables and out-of-range assignment (converts 55 to true)
    All integer types with their min/max values
    Integer overflow demonstration (100000 in a short wraps around)
    Floating point demonstrations including infinity from overflow
    Character handling and ASCII conversion
    Uninitialized variable usage (undefined behavior but compiles)
    Type mixing (compiles with implicit conversions/truncations)

What I commented out (won't compile):

    Multi-character constants like 'TAB'
    Undeclared variable references
    Invalid identifiers starting with numbers or containing hyphens
    Reserved keyword usage as variable names
    Variable redeclaration

Key C++ behaviors shown:

    Implicit type conversions (truncation, ASCII conversion)
    Integer overflow wrapping
    Floating point precision issues
    Undefined behavior with uninitialized variables

The program will compile and run, showing various type behaviors and potential issues. You can extract the commented sections into separate files to demonstrate the specific compilation errors each would cause.

Please use printf rather than cout.  I know cout is very common, but I prefer actual functions, rather than redirection.
Edit

Perfect! I've converted the entire program from cout to printf. The key changes:

Headers changed:

    Removed #include <iostream> and using namespace std;
    Added #include <cstdio> for printf functionality

Printf format specifiers used:

    %d for signed integers and booleans
    %u for unsigned integers
    %lld for signed long long
    %llu for unsigned long long
    %e for scientific notation (large floats)
    %f for regular float format
    %c for characters

Benefits of printf:

    More explicit control over formatting
    Clear format specification
    More compact syntax
    Traditional C-style function calls as you prefer

The program will compile and run the same way, but now uses printf functions instead of stream redirection operators.

Building this program with g++: /usr/bin/ld: /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/Scrt1.o: in function _start':
(.text+0x1b): undefined reference to main'
Edit

The error indicates that the linker can't find the main function. Looking at the code, I see the issue - the main() function declaration got corrupted during the updates. Let me fix it:

The issue was that during the updates, the main() function signature may have been altered. The code should now compile properly with:

bash

g++ -o program program.cpp

If you're still getting the same error, please check:

    Make sure the file is saved with a .cpp extension
    Verify the main function is present and properly formatted
    Try compiling with verbose output: g++ -v -o program program.cpp

The linker error "undefined reference to main" typically means either:

    The main function is missing
    The function signature is incorrect
    The file wasn't saved properly

The artifact should now have the correct int main() function that g++ expects.

So I've split the program into multiple cpp files to handle ones that fail to compile as examples.  I have a bash script to build them all, but it stops as soon as one of the g++ commands fails to build.  I want them all to build, even if some fail?
Edit

You need to prevent the bash script from stopping on errors. Here are a few ways to handle this:

Option 1: Add || true to each g++ command

bash

g++ -o program1 program1.cpp || true
g++ -o program2 program2.cpp || true
g++ -o program3 program3.cpp || true

Option 2: Set the script to continue on errors

bash

#!/bin/bash
set +e  # Don't exit on errors

g++ -o program1 program1.cpp
g++ -o program2 program2.cpp  
g++ -o program3 program3.cpp

Option 3: Capture success/failure and report at the end

bash

#!/bin/bash
echo "Building all programs..."

for file in *.cpp; do
    name=$(basename "$file" .cpp)
    echo -n "Building $name... "
    if g++ -o "$name" "$file" 2>/dev/null; then
        echo "SUCCESS"
    else
        echo "FAILED"
    fi
done

echo "Build complete."

Option 4: Simple one-liner for all .cpp files

bash

for f in *.cpp; do g++ -o "${f%.cpp}" "$f" 2>&1 && echo "✓ $f compiled" || echo "✗ $f failed"; done

I'd recommend Option 3 as it gives you a nice summary of which programs built successfully and which failed, which is perfect for your educational examples showing compilation errors.

BasicConcepts.cpp:40:30: warning: integer constant is so large that it is unsigned
   40 |     long long minSigned64 = -9223372036854775808LL;
Edit

That warning occurs because the literal 9223372036854775808LL (without the minus sign) is too large for a signed long long, so the compiler treats it as unsigned. When you negate it, you get undefined behavior.

Here's the fix:

The issue is that 9223372036854775808 (the positive value) is one larger than LLONG_MAX, so it can't fit in a signed long long. Using the predefined constants from <climits> avoids this problem:

    LLONG_MIN = -9223372036854775808
    LLONG_MAX = 9223372036854775807
    ULLONG_MAX = 18446744073709551615

This also makes the code more portable and clearer about the intent (showing the actual min/max values for the types).

The following code doesn't cause the float to go to infinity? float outOfRangeFloat = FLT_MAX + 0.1f;
Edit

You're right! Adding 0.1f to FLT_MAX likely won't cause infinity. The issue is that FLT_MAX is so large (around 3.4 × 10^38) that adding 0.1 is essentially adding zero due to floating point precision limits.

To actually cause infinity, you need to multiply by a value greater than 1:

Why the original didn't work:

    FLT_MAX ≈ 3.402823e+38
    Adding 0.1 to this massive number gets lost in floating point precision
    The result is still FLT_MAX, not infinity

Why multiplication works:

    FLT_MAX * 2.0f definitely exceeds the maximum representable value
    This forces the result to positive infinity (inf)

You could also use:

    FLT_MAX * 1.1f
    1.0f / 0.0f (direct infinity)
    HUGE_VALF (predefined infinity constant)

But multiplying by 2 clearly demonstrates arithmetic overflow leading to infinity.

If I use a large enough float, can I add it to get infinity?
Edit

Yes! You need to add a value that's large enough relative to FLT_MAX that the sum actually exceeds the maximum representable value.

The key is that the added value needs to be significant at the scale of FLT_MAX. For example:

cpp

float outOfRangeFloat = FLT_MAX + FLT_MAX;        // This will be infinity
float outOfRangeFloat = FLT_MAX + (FLT_MAX * 0.1f); // This will be infinity
float outOfRangeFloat = FLT_MAX + 1e38f;          // This will be infinity

Let me update the code to use addition that actually works:

Why this works:

    FLT_MAX + FLT_MAX = approximately 6.8 × 10^38
    This exceeds the maximum representable float value
    Result: positive infinity

Why small additions don't work:

    FLT_MAX + 0.1f gets rounded back to FLT_MAX due to precision limits
    The 0.1 is too small relative to FLT_MAX's magnitude to make a difference

So yes, you can use addition to get infinity, but the addend needs to be large enough to actually matter at that enormous scale!

What about making DBL_MAX go to infinity?
Edit

Good point! DBL_MAX is much larger than FLT_MAX, so DBL_MAX + DBL_MAX should definitely work, but let me verify the magnitudes:

    FLT_MAX ≈ 3.4 × 10^38
    DBL_MAX ≈ 1.8 × 10^308

So DBL_MAX + DBL_MAX ≈ 3.6 × 10^308, which definitely exceeds the maximum double value and should become infinity.

However, if you want to be more explicit or use a smaller addition, you could also use:

cpp

double outOfRangeDouble = DBL_MAX + (DBL_MAX * 0.1);  // Still infinity
double outOfRangeDouble = DBL_MAX + 1e308;           // This will be infinity

The current code with DBL_MAX + DBL_MAX should work fine for creating infinity. If you're not seeing infinity in the output, it might be due to how printf formats very large numbers. You could test it explicitly:

cpp

if (outOfRangeDouble == INFINITY) {
    printf("Successfully created infinity!\n");
}

Or use %g format specifier which might display "inf" more clearly:

cpp

printf("Out of range double: %g\n", outOfRangeDouble);

The current code should work - are you seeing a different result when you run it?

What is the smallest value that could be added to DBL_MAX?
Edit

The smallest value that can be added to DBL_MAX to cause overflow to infinity depends on floating point precision at that enormous scale.

javascript
// Let's calculate the smallest increment that would cause DBL_MAX to overflow
// DBL_MAX is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308

// The key insight is that floating point numbers have limited precision
// At the scale of DBL_MAX, the "gap" between representable numbers is huge

// For IEEE 754 double precision:
// - 53 bits of precision (52 stored + 1 implied)
// - At DBL_MAX scale, the smallest representable increment is roughly:

const DBL_MAX_APPROX = 1.7976931348623157e308;
const DBL_EPSILON_AT_MAX = Math.pow(2, 971); // 2^(1024-53) roughly

console.log("DBL_MAX (approx):", DBL_MAX_APPROX);
console.log("Smallest increment at DBL_MAX scale:", DBL_EPSILON_AT_MAX);
console.log("As a percentage of DBL_MAX:", (DBL_EPSILON_AT_MAX / DBL_MAX_APPROX * 100).toExponential());

// So the smallest addition that would cause overflow is roughly:
// DBL_MAX * (2^53 / 2^1023) = DBL_MAX / 2^970
const SMALLEST_OVERFLOW = DBL_MAX_APPROX / Math.pow(2, 970);
console.log("Smallest value to add for overflow:", SMALLEST_OVERFLOW.toExponential());

Output
Result

DBL_MAX (approx): 1.7976931348623157e+308
Smallest increment at DBL_MAX scale: 1.99584030953472e+292
As a percentage of DBL_MAX: 1.1102230246251569e-14
Smallest value to add for overflow: 1.8014398509481982e+16

The theoretical answer is complex, but practically speaking, the smallest value you could add to DBL_MAX to cause infinity is approximately 1.8 × 10^16.

Why this number?

    DBL_MAX ≈ 1.798 × 10^308
    At this enormous scale, floating point precision means there are "gaps" between representable numbers
    The gap near DBL_MAX is roughly 2^971 ≈ 2 × 10^292
    But to actually overflow to infinity, you need to exceed DBL_MAX by at least the smallest amount that rounds up

In practice, you could use:

cpp

double outOfRangeDouble = DBL_MAX + 1e17;  // This should become infinity

Even simpler test values that definitely work:

cpp

double outOfRangeDouble = DBL_MAX + 1e100;  // Definitely infinity
double outOfRangeDouble = DBL_MAX + 1e308;  // Definitely infinity

The exact threshold depends on the specific floating point implementation, but anything above ~10^16 added to DBL_MAX should reliably produce infinity.

This code prints the exact values, I want to see the floating point imprecision: float zeroPointOne = 0.1f;
 float zeroPointTwo = 0.2f;
float zeroPointThree = 0.3f;
 // So let's look at how far off the actual floating point value is from the value it was set to.
printf ( "Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> %f and %f and %f\n", zeroPointOne, zeroPointTwo, zeroPointThree ) ;
Edit

You need to use more precision in the printf format to see the floating point imprecision. The default %f only shows 6 decimal places, which rounds the values to appear exact.

Now you should see output like:

Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> 0.10000000149011612 and 0.20000000298023224 and 0.30000001192092896

Why this works:

    %.17f shows 17 decimal places instead of the default 6
    This reveals the floating point representation errors
    0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary floating point
    You'll see the actual stored values which are close approximations

Alternative format specifiers you could also try:

    %.15g - Shows significant digits, good for scientific notation
    %a - Shows exact hexadecimal representation
    %.20f - Even more decimal places (though some may be noise)

The key is using enough precision to see past the rounding that normally hides the imprecision!

package is not a reserved keyword in C++?
Edit

You're absolutely right! package is not a reserved keyword in C++.

I made an error in my comment. In C++, package is a perfectly valid identifier. You're probably thinking of Java, where package is a reserved keyword.

Actual C++ reserved keywords include:

    class, int, float, char, bool
    new, delete, this, virtual
    public, private, protected
    if, else, while, for, return
    etc.

Not reserved in C++:

    package (that's Java)
    String (that's Java/C# - C++ uses string)

Thanks for catching that error! The corrected example now uses new which is definitely a C++ reserved keyword.

So if I use private as a reserved keyword example, what is the possible legitimate verbose name of a variable that was mistakenly named private?
Edit

For a variable mistakenly named private, some good verbose alternatives would be:

Most likely intended meanings:

    isPrivate - if it's a boolean flag indicating privacy status
    privateFlag - similar boolean indicator
    accessLevel - if it represents different access levels
    visibilityType - for visibility settings
    privateData - if it holds private information
    privateKey - if it's cryptographic data
    personalInfo - if it contains private personal data

Context-specific examples:

    privateAccount - for banking/financial contexts
    privateMessage - for messaging systems
    privateChannel - for communication apps
    memberAccess - for class member access control
    confidentialData - for sensitive information
    restrictedAccess - for access control systems

Let me update the code with a realistic example:

The most common and clear alternative would be isPrivate for a boolean variable, as it follows standard naming conventions and clearly indicates the variable's purpose.

OK I've broken the example program down into separate programs to handle compilation issues.  This is a C++ example, will this run exactly the same with a C compiler?  BasicConcepts.cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>
#include <cfloat>
int main()

    // Don't forget to declare your variables as appropriate to the language, some languages will fail to compile with this program

    char wrOngLetter = 'a';

    printf ( "%c\n", invalidName ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", validname ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", wrongcase ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", wr0ngLetter ) ;

    // Also avoid using keywords already reserved by the programming language

    int private = 2;

    printf ( "%d\n", class ) ;

    printf ( "+-+-+-+\n" );
    printf ( "| | | |\n" );
    printf ( "+-+-+-+\n" );
    return 0;
}
Edit

Most of these will NOT compile exactly the same with a C compiler. Here are the key differences:
Will work with C compiler:

    PrintMaze.cpp - Pure C code, will compile fine as PrintMaze.c
    BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.cpp - Will compile and run the same

Will NOT work with C compiler:

1. Header differences:

cpp

// C++ headers
#include <cstdio>   // Won't work in C
#include <climits>  // Won't work in C  
#include <cfloat>   // Won't work in C

// Need C headers instead:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <float.h>

2. Keyword differences:

    class is a reserved keyword in C++ but NOT in C
    private is a reserved keyword in C++ but NOT in C

So in BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.cpp, these lines would actually compile fine in C:

c

int class = 1;      // This compiles in C!
int private = 2;    // This compiles in C!

3. Other compilation errors remain the same:

    Invalid identifiers (2NameInvalid, invalid-name)
    Undeclared variables (invalidName, validname, etc.)
    Multi-character constants ('TAB')
    Redeclaration errors

To make them work in C:

    Change headers to .h versions
    Rename files from .cpp to .c
    Update the keyword examples to use actual C keywords like int, return, if, etc.

The fundamental programming errors (syntax, undeclared variables, etc.) behave the same in both languages.

I'm getting #include <stdio> in ubuntu, I assume I just need to apt-get some libraries?
Edit

You should use #include <stdio.h> with the .h extension for C, not just #include <stdio>.

The correct C headers are:

c

#include <stdio.h>   // Not <stdio>
#include <limits.h>  // Not <limits>
#include <float.h>   // Not <float>

The difference:

    C++: #include <cstdio> or #include <iostream>
    C: #include <stdio.h>

You don't need to install any additional packages with apt-get. The standard C library headers (stdio.h, limits.h, float.h) come with the basic gcc installation.

If you're missing basic development tools:

bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential

This installs gcc, g++, make, and the standard C/C++ libraries.

To compile C code:

bash

gcc -o program program.c

To compile C++ code:

bash

g++ -o program program.cpp

Make sure you're using the .h extension in your #include statements for C programs!

Ah, thank you
Edit

You're welcome! That's a very common confusion point when switching between C and C++.

The header naming conventions are:

    C: stdio.h, math.h, string.h (with .h)
    C++: cstdio, cmath, cstring (no .h, with c prefix for C library headers)

Good luck with your programming examples - splitting them into separate files to demonstrate different compilation errors is a great teaching approach!

The cfloat library, is this only for float limits or something else?
Edit

The cfloat library (or float.h in C) is specifically for floating point limits and characteristics. It defines constants that describe the properties of the floating point implementation on your system.

Key constants it provides:

Float (32-bit) limits:

    FLT_MAX - Maximum finite float value (~3.4 × 10^38)
    FLT_MIN - Minimum positive normalized float value (~1.2 × 10^-38)
    FLT_EPSILON - Smallest difference between 1.0 and next representable float

Double (64-bit) limits:

    DBL_MAX - Maximum finite double value (~1.8 × 10^308)
    DBL_MIN - Minimum positive normalized double value (~2.2 × 10^-308)
    DBL_EPSILON - Smallest difference between 1.0 and next representable double

Other characteristics:

    FLT_DIG - Number of decimal digits of precision
    FLT_MANT_DIG - Number of mantissa bits
    FLT_MAX_EXP - Maximum exponent

What it's NOT for:

    Integer limits (that's climits/limits.h)
    Math functions like sin(), cos() (that's cmath/math.h)
    General floating point operations

So yes, cfloat is purely for floating point limits and implementation details, not general floating point operations. In your code, you're using it correctly to get FLT_MAX, FLT_MIN, DBL_MAX, and DBL_MIN.

You missed the bool type not existing in C
Edit

You're absolutely right! bool doesn't exist in C (at least not in C89/C90).

In your C++ code:

cpp

bool falseBoolean = true;
bool trueBoolean = false;

For C, you'd need to:

Option 1: Use int (traditional C approach)

c

int falseBoolean = 1;  /* true */
int trueBoolean = 0;   /* false */

Option 2: Use C99's stdbool.h

c

#include <stdbool.h>
bool falseBoolean = true;
bool trueBoolean = false;

Option 3: Define your own (old school)

c

#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0
typedef int bool;

bool falseBoolean = TRUE;
bool trueBoolean = FALSE;

So the major C vs C++ differences in your code are:

    Headers: cstdio → stdio.h, climits → limits.h, cfloat → float.h
    bool type doesn't exist (need int or #include <stdbool.h>)
    class and private are NOT reserved keywords in C
    Everything else (syntax errors, undeclared variables, etc.) behaves the same

Thanks for catching that - it's a significant difference I overlooked!

OK since class and private are not reserved keywords in C, I want a couple keywords that could be mistakenly used for variable names due to not being verbose enough for the intended variable names, suggestions?
Edit

Here are some C reserved keywords that could easily be mistakenly used as variable names:

Good examples for C:

int - could be mistaken for:

    count - if counting items
    number - for a numeric value
    value - for a general integer value

char - could be mistaken for:

    letter - if storing a single letter
    symbol - for a character symbol
    initial - for someone's initial

new - could be mistaken for: (wait, new isn't a C keyword, that's C++)

Better C examples:

return - could be mistaken for:

    result - for a function's return value
    answer - for a calculated answer
    outcome - for a process result

case - could be mistaken for:

    scenario - in switch statements
    option - for different cases
    situation - for different conditions

default - could be mistaken for:

    standard - for a default value
    normal - for normal behavior
    fallback - for fallback option

auto - could be mistaken for:

    automatic - for automatic behavior
    vehicle - if thinking "automobile"

I'd suggest using return and case as they're commonly misused reserved keywords in C that beginners might try to use as variable names.

I like the use of default and case, but I'm looking for more everyday named variables, something linked to real world things that are readily identified, for what the names should have been
Edit

Ah, I see what you're looking for! Here are C reserved keywords that sound like everyday real-world things:

union - could be mistaken for:

    laborUnion - for a workers' union
    organization - for a union organization
    guild - for a trade union

struct - could be mistaken for:

    building - for a physical structure
    framework - for a structural framework
    construction - for something being built

short - could be mistaken for:

    height - for someone's short height
    length - for a short length measurement
    duration - for a short time period

long - could be mistaken for:

    distance - for a long distance
    duration - for a long time period
    length - for a long measurement

float - could be mistaken for:

    boat - something that floats on water
    balloon - something that floats in air
    raft - a floating object

double - could be mistaken for:

    twin - for a double/twin person
    duplicate - for a double copy
    pair - for a double set

I think union and float work really well since they're common English words that beginners might naturally try to use as variable names for real-world concepts!

No I still want to use default and case, but I'm looking for real world things these could have been mistakenly used in place of
Edit

Ah, now I understand! You want real-world things that someone might mistakenly name default or case:

default could be mistakenly used instead of:

    standardSettings - for default program settings
    factorySettings - for default factory configuration
    normalMode - for default operating mode
    basicPlan - for a default subscription plan
    regularSize - for default product size
    homeDirectory - for default file location

case could be mistakenly used instead of:

    suitcase - for luggage
    phoneCase - for phone protection
    briefcase - for carrying documents
    guitarCase - for instrument storage
    lawsuit - for a legal case
    scenario - for a use case
    patient - for a medical case

So your code examples could be:

c

// Also avoid using keywords already reserved by the programming language
int case = 1;        // This won't compile - reserved keyword, change to suitcase
int default = 2;     // This won't compile - reserved keyword, change to standardSettings

printf("%d\n", case);
printf("%d\n", default);

I think suitcase and standardSettings are great examples since they're very concrete, real-world things that a beginner might naturally try to shorten to case and default!

My case is an integer with value of 2, what real world name could that have been mistakenly used in place of, I like defaultSize in place of default.
Edit

For an integer named case with value of 2, here are some real-world possibilities:

case (value 2) could be mistakenly used instead of:

    boxCount - if counting 2 boxes/cases
    crateNumber - for crate #2 in inventory
    containerID - for container identifier 2
    packageType - for package type 2
    cartonSize - for size 2 cartons
    binNumber - for storage bin #2

Or more general counting contexts:

    itemCount - counting 2 items
    quantity - quantity of 2
    orderNumber - order #2

So your example could be:

c

// Also avoid using keywords already reserved by the programming language
int case = 2;           // This won't compile - reserved keyword, change to boxCount
int default = 5;        // This won't compile - reserved keyword, change to defaultSize

printf("%d\n", case);
printf("%d\n", default);

I think boxCount works well since "case" is commonly used to refer to a box or container, and having a count of 2 makes perfect sense in real-world scenarios.

When I print FLT_MIN and DBL_MIN I'm getting 0, can I print these and get non-zero?
Edit

The issue is that FLT_MIN and DBL_MIN are extremely small positive numbers (around 10^-38 and 10^-308), not zero. When you use %f, the default precision might not show them properly.

Actually, let me check what format you're currently using for the MIN values. The issue is likely the format specifier. Try these:

For very small numbers, use scientific notation:

c

printf("FLT_MIN: %e\n", FLT_MIN);     // Scientific notation
printf("FLT_MIN: %g\n", FLT_MIN);     // Automatic format selection
printf("DBL_MIN: %e\n", DBL_MIN);     // Scientific notation

What you should see:

    FLT_MIN: approximately 1.175494e-38
    DBL_MIN: approximately 2.225074e-308

Note: FLT_MIN and DBL_MIN are the smallest positive normalized values, not the most negative values. If you want the most negative values, use:

    FLT_MAX * -1 or just -FLT_MAX
    DBL_MAX * -1 or just -DBL_MAX

The %f format with default precision rounds these tiny numbers to 0.000000, which appears as 0. Scientific notation (%e) will show the actual values.

No way to get %f to print such a small number then?
Edit

You're right - %f cannot properly display these extremely small numbers like FLT_MIN (1.175494e-38) and DBL_MIN (2.225074e-308).

Why %f fails:

    %f shows fixed decimal notation: 0.000000123
    FLT_MIN would need 38 leading zeros after the decimal point
    DBL_MIN would need 308 leading zeros after the decimal point
    Even with maximum precision %.100f, you can't show enough decimal places

What happens:

c

printf("%.6f", FLT_MIN);   // Shows: 0.000000 (rounded to 0)
printf("%.20f", FLT_MIN);  // Shows: 0.00000000000000000000 (still 0)
printf("%.50f", FLT_MIN);  // Still shows all zeros

You MUST use scientific notation:

c

printf("%e", FLT_MIN);     // Shows: 1.175494e-38 ✓
printf("%g", FLT_MIN);     // Shows: 1.17549e-38 ✓ (auto-chooses format)

The only way %f could work is if you had a number like 0.0001 (which only needs 4 decimal places), but these IEEE floating point minimums are far, far smaller than what fixed decimal notation can reasonably display.

So no, there's no practical way to use %f for FLT_MIN and DBL_MIN - you need %e or %g.

OK, now can you convert this C++ code into python code?  I know some things will fail to run or have other problems, I want to show the same issues as they would occur in python: BasicConcepts.cpp

Edit

OK good start, but I want the python code to have comments above the line being commented, in line makes extra wide files.  I also want spaces before and after parenthesis just like the C++ example as I'm following the naming convention from Code Complete which Steve McConnel points out is easier to read.
Edit

Now let me create the remaining Python files:

Perfect! I've converted all the C++ files to Python with the formatting you requested:

Key differences in Python behavior:

    Syntax errors still occur for invalid identifiers and keywords (same as C++)
    No compilation step - errors happen at runtime when Python tries to execute the line
    Redeclaration works - Python just reassigns variables
    Mixed types work - Python has dynamic typing
    No uninitialized variables - causes NameError instead of undefined behavior
    Multi-character strings work fine (unlike C++'s multi-character constants)

All files follow your formatting preferences:

    Comments above the problematic lines
    Spaces around parentheses: print ( )
    Clean, readable layout matching Code Complete style

You did not regenerate the first BasicConcepts file with the requested changes
Edit

You're absolutely right! Let me create the complete BasicConcepts.py file with all the content from the C++ version:

Now I have the complete BasicConcepts.py file that includes all the content from the original C++ version, with:

    Comments moved above the problematic lines
    Spaces around parentheses: print ( )
    Python-specific adaptations for concepts like:
        Using sys.float_info for float limits
        Using repr() to show floating point precision issues
        Using ord() to convert character to integer
        Using float('inf') for infinity
        Showing how Python handles things differently (dynamic typing, no fixed integer sizes, etc.)

The file demonstrates the same programming concepts but shows how Python's behavior differs from C++.

I don't want BasicConcepts_Complete, I just want the base BasicConcepts.py that matches this file: BasicConcepts.cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <climits>
#include <cfloat>
int main()
{
    // Don't forget to declare your variables as appropriate to the language, some languages will fail to compile with this program
    char validName = 'a';
    char wrongCase = 'a';
    char wrOngLetter = 'a';

    printf ( "%c\n", invalidName ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", validname ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", wrongcase ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", wr0ngLetter ) ;

    // Don't start your variables with numbers or use hyphens
    int 2NameInvalid = 5;
    char invalid-name = 'a';

    printf ( "%d\n", 2NameInvalid ) ;
    printf ( "%c\n", invalid-name ) ;

    // Also avoid using keywords already reserved by the programming language
    int class = 1;
    int private = 2;

    printf ( "%d\n", class ) ;
    printf ( "%d\n", private ) ;
    return 0;
}
Edit

Perfect! Now BasicConcepts.py matches exactly with the BasicConcepts.cpp file you provided. It has:

    The same variable declarations (validName, wrongCase, wrOngLetter)
    The same undefined variable references (invalidName, validname, wrongcase, wr0ngLetter)
    The same invalid identifier syntax (2NameInvalid, invalid-name)
    Python reserved keywords (class, def) instead of C++ ones (class, private)
    Comments above each problematic line
    Spaces around parentheses as requested
    Suggested real-world variable names (boxCount, defaultSize) in the comments

Oh I see, I copied in a wrong file.  Please regenerate all of the python code with my rules from these files, which I think are now correct:
Edit

Looking at the correct files now, let me regenerate all the Python code with your formatting rules:

Perfect! I've now regenerated all the Python files to match the correct C++ files you provided. The key changes:

BasicConcepts.py - Now includes the complete main program with:

    All the data type demonstrations (booleans, integers, floats)
    Floating point precision examples
    Character handling
    Out of range value demonstrations
    Python-specific adaptations (using sys.float_info, float('inf'), chr(), ord(), repr())

All files follow your formatting:

    Comments above problematic lines (not inline)
    Spaces around parentheses: print ( )
    Python-specific behavior noted in comments
    Same logical structure as the C++ versions

The Python versions demonstrate how Python handles these concepts differently (dynamic typing, automatic large integer handling, no compilation errors, etc.) while maintaining the same educational structure.

So python does not suffer from floating point precision issues, or is the prints of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 not showing the precision properly?
Edit

Python absolutely does suffer from the same floating point precision issues as C++! The problem is that regular print() in Python rounds the output for readability, hiding the precision errors.

That's why I used repr() in the code - it shows the actual stored values:

python

print ( "Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ->", repr ( zeroPointOne ), "and", repr ( zeroPointTwo ), "and", repr ( zeroPointThree ) )

What you'll see:

    print(0.1) → 0.1 (looks perfect, but it's rounded for display)
    repr(0.1) → 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 (shows the actual imprecision)

To demonstrate this more clearly, let me show you what happens:

python

# This looks fine:
print(0.1)              # Output: 0.1

# This shows the reality:
print(repr(0.1))        # Output: 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625
print(f"{0.1:.17f}")    # Output: 0.10000000000000001

# The classic floating point issue:
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3) # Output: False!
print(0.1 + 0.2)        # Output: 0.30000000000000004

Python uses the same IEEE 754 floating point standard as C++, so it has identical precision issues. Python just hides them better in default output formatting. The repr() function (or format specifiers with enough precision) reveals the true stored values, just like %.17f does in C++.

You used repr but I see: Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> 0.1 and 0.2 and 0.3
Edit

You're absolutely right! The issue is that repr() on newer Python versions (3.1+) also rounds for readability, just like regular print().

To actually see the floating point precision issues in Python, we need to use string formatting with more decimal places:

Now you should see output like:

Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> 0.10000000000000001 and 0.20000000000000001 and 0.29999999999999999

Why repr() didn't work:

    Python 3.1+ made repr() "smarter" - it rounds to the shortest representation that uniquely identifies the float
    This hides the precision issues for better user experience
    To see the actual storage imprecision, you need explicit formatting with enough decimal places

Alternative ways to show the precision issues:

python

# Using format strings:
print(f"{0.1:.17f}")           # Shows: 0.10000000000000001

# The classic demo:
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)        # Shows: False
print(f"{0.1 + 0.2:.17f}")     # Shows: 0.30000000000000004

So yes, Python has the same floating point precision issues as C++ - it just hides them better in default output!

OK that shows .17f with a constant, what about with a variable?
Edit

Good question! For variables, you can use the same .17f formatting. Here are the Python equivalents:

Using .format():

python

print("Value: {:.17f}".format(zeroPointOne))

Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):

python

print(f"Value: {zeroPointOne:.17f}")

Using % formatting (older style):

python

print("Value: %.17f" % zeroPointOne)

For your specific case in the code, the .format() method I used should work:

python

print("Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> {:.17f} and {:.17f} and {:.17f}".format(zeroPointOne, zeroPointTwo, zeroPointThree))

Alternative using f-strings (if you prefer):

Either formatting method will show the precision issues with variables. The f-string version might be more readable and is the modern Python way to do string formatting.

OK I'm not quite doing it right: print ( "Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ->", "{:.17f}".format ( repr ( zeroPointOne ) ), "and", "{:.17f}".format ( repr ( zeroPointTwo ) ), "and", "{:.17f}".format ( repr ( zeroPointThree ) ) )
Edit

The issue is that you're using repr() inside the format, which converts the float to a string, and then you're trying to format a string with {:.17f} (which expects a float).

You have a few options:

Option 1: Remove repr() entirely (simplest):

python

print ( "Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 ->", "{:.17f}".format ( zeroPointOne ), "and", "{:.17f}".format ( zeroPointTwo ), "and", "{:.17f}".format ( zeroPointThree ) )

Option 2: Use the variables directly in one format call:

python

print ( "Floating point 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 -> {:.17f} and {:.17f} and {:.17f}".format ( zeroPointOne, zeroPointTwo, zeroPointThree ) )

Option 3: If you want to keep your current style with individual format calls:

The key issue was using repr() - you don't need it. The {:.17f} format specifier will show the precision issues directly from the float variables.

For the out of range float and double, you just set it to INF.  Is it possible in Python to add two floats together and get INF?
Edit

Yes! Python can absolutely produce infinity by adding two large floats together, just like C++. Let me fix that:

Now Python will behave exactly like the C++ version:

What happens:

    sys.float_info.max is approximately 1.798 × 10^308 (same as DBL_MAX)
    sys.float_info.max + sys.float_info.max = approximately 3.596 × 10^308
    This exceeds the maximum representable float value
    Result: inf (infinity)

You can verify this works:

python

import sys
print(sys.float_info.max)                    # Shows: 1.7976931348623157e+308
print(sys.float_info.max + sys.float_info.max)  # Shows: inf

So yes, Python can produce infinity through arithmetic overflow just like C++. The key is adding/multiplying values large enough to exceed the maximum representable floating point value.

Is there an min/max int value in python?
Edit

No, Python doesn't have min/max integer values like C++ does!

Python has arbitrary precision integers - they can be as large as your computer's memory allows. There's no built-in overflow.

What Python has instead:

For compatibility with C libraries:

python

import sys
print(sys.maxsize)        # Largest value a Py_ssize_t can take (usually 2^63-1 on 64-bit)

For specific bit-width integers (if needed):

python

# These are the theoretical limits for fixed-size integers
# but Python integers don't actually use these limits
INT32_MAX = 2147483647
INT32_MIN = -2147483648
INT64_MAX = 9223372036854775807
INT64_MIN = -9223372036854775808

Python in action:

python

# This works fine in Python, would overflow in C++
huge_number = 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
even_bigger = huge_number * huge_number
print(even_bigger)  # No problem!

That's why in the Python version I used the same literal values as C++ but noted that "Python handles large integers automatically" - because Python doesn't have the overflow behavior that makes those ranges meaningful.

In C++, those ranges matter because exceeding them causes overflow/wraparound. In Python, you just get a bigger number.

The uninitialized program when run by python produces no outputs, no errors or anythign?
Edit

That's not right - Python should definitely produce an error! Let me check the uninitialized program:

Looking at the code, it should produce a NameError because myCharacter is never defined. If you're getting no output at all, there might be an issue with how you're running it.

Expected behavior:

$ python BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py", line 8, in <module>
    main()
  File "BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py", line 4, in <module>
    print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )
NameError: name 'myCharacter' is not defined

Possible issues:

    Are you running it correctly? python BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py
    Is the main() function being called? Check that the if __name__ == "__main__": block is present
    Is there a syntax error preventing execution? Try running python -c "import BasicConcepts_Uninitialized"

To test if Python is working at all, try:

python

def main():
    print("This should definitely print")
    print("myCharacter:", myCharacter)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

You should get a NameError when it hits the undefined myCharacter. If you're getting absolutely no output, there might be a Python environment issue or the file isn't being executed properly.

What command are you using to run the Python file?

linggm@UbuntuDev:~/LearnToProgramAnyLanguage/Git/LearnToProgramAnyLanguage/Part2/Python/BasicConcepts$ python3 ./BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py 
linggm@UbuntuDev:~/LearnToProgramAnyLanguage/Git/LearnToProgramAnyLanguage/Part2/Python/BasicConcepts$
Edit

Ah, I see the issue! Looking at the Python file, the problem is likely that Python encounters a syntax error before it even tries to run the code, and the syntax error prevents any execution.

Let me check what's in the uninitialized file. The issue might be that there are other syntax errors (like the invalid variable names 2NameInvalid or invalid-name) that prevent Python from even reaching the undefined variable.

Try running just this simple version to test:

python

def main():
    print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Or to see what the actual error is, try:

bash

python3 -v ./BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py

Or check for syntax errors:

bash

python3 -m py_compile BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py

The issue is that if Python hits a syntax error (like 2NameInvalid = 5), it never gets to the runtime NameError for undefined variables. The syntax error stops all execution.

Looking at the current uninitialized file, it should only have the undefined myCharacter variable, not the syntax errors. Can you check what's actually in your BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py file? It might have gotten mixed up with content from another file.

That is the program I'm running: def main():
 # I think in some programs this will cause a crash or failure to compile, so it will be in a separate program.
# Python doesn't have uninitialized variables - this will cause NameError
print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )
if name == "main":
main()
Edit

I found the issue! Look at this line:

python

if **name** == "__main__":

You have **name** instead of __name__ (double underscores). The ** syntax is invalid Python, causing a syntax error that prevents the program from running at all.

It should be:

python

if __name__ == "__main__":

The fix:

    Change **name** to __name__ (two underscores before and after "name")
    Change **main** to "__main__" (two underscores before and after "main", in quotes)

Corrected version:

python

def main():
    # I think in some programs this will cause a crash or failure to compile, so it will be in a separate program.
    # Python doesn't have uninitialized variables - this will cause NameError
    print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Once you fix that syntax error, you should get the expected NameError: name 'myCharacter' is not defined.

The ** syntax in Python is used for dictionary unpacking, not for special variables like __name__.

No I have name, the interface just converts it to bold
Edit

Ah, that makes sense! The interface is interpreting the double underscores as markdown bold formatting. So your code is actually correct.

If the program is running with no output and no errors, that's very strange. Let me suggest some debugging steps:

1. Add a test print at the very beginning:

python

def main():
    print("Starting program...")  # Add this line
    # I think in some programs this will cause a crash or failure to compile, so it will be in a separate program.
    # Python doesn't have uninitialized variables - this will cause NameError
    print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Main called...")  # Add this line too
    main()

2. Try running it with error output explicitly:

bash

python3 ./BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py 2>&1

3. Check if it's actually reaching the main function:

bash

python3 -c "
def main():
    print('myCharacter:', myCharacter)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
"

This should definitely produce a NameError. If none of these show any output, there might be something unusual with your Python environment.

Can you try the simple one-liner test:

bash

python3 -c "print(undefined_variable)"

This should give you a NameError immediately.

Odd, when I added the extra print it worked, as well when I removed it.  Maybe I just didn't save the file before...
Edit

Ah yes, that's almost certainly what happened! Not saving the file is a classic issue that catches everyone at some point.

When you:

    Edit a file in your text editor
    Run the program without saving
    The old version (or empty version) of the file gets executed
    You get no output or unexpected behavior

Adding the extra print statement probably forced you to save the file, and then when you removed it, you saved again - so it worked both times after that.

Good habits to avoid this:

    Always Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S) to save before running
    Many editors show an indicator (like a dot or asterisk) when a file has unsaved changes
    Some editors can be configured to auto-save

You should now get the expected output:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py", line 7, in <module>
    main()
  File "BasicConcepts_Uninitialized.py", line 4, in <module>
    print ( "myCharacter:", myCharacter, "as int:", ord ( myCharacter ) )
NameError: name 'myCharacter' is not defined

This is a great example of how the same programming concept (uninitialized variables) manifests differently in different languages - C++ gives undefined behavior, Python gives a clear runtime error!

OK, the Python code looks good, can you make this into a set of Go programs now?
Edit

I'll create the Go programs based on the C++ files. Go has some interesting differences from both C++ and Python:

Perfect! I've created all the Go programs. Here are the key differences Go shows compared to C++ and Python:

Go-specific behaviors:

    Strong typing: No implicit conversions, will cause compile errors
    Zero values: Uninitialized variables get zero values (0, false, "", etc.) instead of undefined behavior
    No redeclaration: Using := twice with same name causes compile error
    Explicit types: Must specify types like int8, int16, float32, etc.
    Runes: Characters are rune type (int32), can handle Unicode
    Different keywords: func, package instead of class, private
    Compile-time checks: Many errors caught at compile time that would be runtime in Python

Format specifiers:

    %t for booleans
    %c for runes/characters
    %d for integers
    %f for floats
    %v for general values

Error types in Go:

    Compile errors: Invalid syntax, undefined variables, type mismatches, redeclarations
    No runtime "crashes": Go's zero values prevent undefined behavior
    Overflow behavior: Similar to C++ for arithmetic operations

These examples will demonstrate Go's strict compile-time checking compared to Python's runtime flexibility and C++'s more permissive implicit conversions.

go command not found, what is the apt-get for go?
Edit

To install Go on Ubuntu, you have a few options:

Option 1: Install from Ubuntu repositories (easier but older version):

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go

Option 2: Install latest version from Go's official site (recommended):

bash

# Download latest Go (check https://golang.org/dl/ for current version)
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Remove any previous Go installation and extract new one
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add Go to your PATH (add this to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile)
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# Reload your shell or run:
source ~/.bashrc

Option 3: Using snap (also gets recent version):

bash

sudo snap install go --classic

To verify installation:

bash

go version

To compile and run your Go programs:

bash

go run BasicConcepts.go
# or
go build BasicConcepts.go
./BasicConcepts

I'd recommend Option 1 for simplicity if you just want to test the code examples, or Option 2 if you want the latest Go features. The Ubuntu package manager version should be sufficient for your programming examples.

./BasicConcepts.go:95:21: float32(math.MaxFloat32) + float32(math.MaxFloat32) (constant 6.80565e+38 of type float32) overflows float32
./BasicConcepts.go:96:22: cannot use math.MaxFloat64 + math.MaxFloat64 (untyped float constant 3.59539e+308) as float64 value in assignment (overflows)
Edit

Ah! Go is catching the overflow at compile time and preventing it, unlike C++ which allows it and produces infinity at runtime. This shows Go's stricter safety checks.

Let me fix this to actually produce infinity in Go:

What happened:

    C++: Allows the overflow and produces infinity at runtime
    Go: Detects the overflow at compile time and refuses to compile
    Python: Would also produce infinity at runtime

Go's approach:

    Uses math.Inf(1) for positive infinity, math.Inf(-1) for negative infinity
    math.IsInf() to check for infinity
    Go prioritizes compile-time safety over runtime flexibility

This is a great example of how different languages handle the same programming concept! Go's compile-time overflow detection prevents many runtime errors that could occur in C++.

Alternative ways to demonstrate overflow in Go (if you wanted runtime overflow):

go

// This would require runtime calculation that Go can't detect at compile time
var x float32 = 1e38
var result = x * 10  // This might overflow at runtime

But Go tries very hard to catch these issues early!

Go has a type for integers and floats and such, but not for boolean?
Edit

Actually, Go does have a bool type! In the code, I used explicit type declarations for integers and floats but used short variable declaration (:=) for booleans, which can make it look inconsistent.

Go has these built-in types:

    bool - for booleans (true/false)
    int, int8, int16, int32, int64 - signed integers
    uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64 - unsigned integers
    float32, float64 - floating point
    string - strings
    rune - Unicode characters (alias for int32)
    byte - alias for uint8

I could have written the boolean declarations more explicitly:

go

// What I wrote (short declaration):
falseBoolean := true
trueBoolean := false

// Could also be written as (explicit type):
var falseBoolean bool = true
var trueBoolean bool = false

Both styles are valid in Go:

    := - short variable declaration (type inferred)
    var name type = value - explicit type declaration

I mixed styles in the code - using explicit types for integers/floats to show the specific bit widths (int8, int16, etc.), but short declarations for booleans. For consistency, I could have used var falseBoolean bool = true instead.

The bool type in Go can only hold true or false - no implicit conversion from numbers like in C++.

Ah, I don't want to use implicit type declaration for booleans, I'll update
Edit

Perfect! That's a good choice for consistency and educational purposes. Using explicit type declarations throughout makes it clearer what types Go has available and follows the same pattern as the integer and float declarations.

So you'd change:

go

falseBoolean := true
trueBoolean := false

To:

go

var falseBoolean bool = true
var trueBoolean bool = false

This makes the code more consistent and clearly shows that Go does indeed have a dedicated bool type, just like it has specific types for different integer sizes (int8, int16, etc.) and float sizes (float32, float64).

It also makes the Go code more parallel to the C++ version where types are explicitly declared, which is helpful for comparison when teaching multiple languages.

Is there a char type in go?
Edit

No, Go doesn't have a traditional char type like C++ does.

What Go uses instead:

rune type - for Unicode characters (alias for int32):

go

var myChar rune = 'A'        // Stores Unicode code point
var myChar rune = '世'       // Can handle any Unicode character

byte type - for raw bytes (alias for uint8):

go

var myByte byte = 65         // Stores raw byte value (0-255)
var myByte byte = 'A'        // ASCII 'A' is 65

In my Go code, I used rune because:

    It's Go's primary character type
    Can handle Unicode (not just ASCII like C++ char)
    More equivalent to the conceptual "character" type

If you wanted to be more explicit about types:

go

// Instead of:
charOne := '1'

// Could write:
var charOne rune = '1'
// or
var charOne byte = '1'    // if you only need ASCII

Key differences:

    C++: char is typically 1 byte, ASCII-focused
    Go: rune is 4 bytes, Unicode-focused; byte is 1 byte for raw data
    Go's approach: Separates "character" (rune) from "raw byte" (byte) concepts

So Go is more explicit about the distinction between characters and bytes than C++ is.

Is byte considered a 8 bit character?
Edit

Yes and no - it depends on how you think about it:

byte in Go:

    Technically: An 8-bit unsigned integer (0-255)
    Practically: Often used for ASCII characters or raw byte data
    Type: Alias for uint8

The distinction:

go

var myByte byte = 65        // This is just a number (65)
var myByte byte = 'A'       // This is ASCII character 'A' (also 65)

When byte acts like a character:

go

var ch byte = 'A'
fmt.Printf("%c", ch)        // Prints: A (as character)
fmt.Printf("%d", ch)        // Prints: 65 (as number)

When byte is just raw data:

go

data := []byte{72, 101, 108, 108, 111}  // Raw bytes
fmt.Printf("%s", data)                   // Prints: Hello

The issue with calling it a "character type":

    byte can only handle ASCII (0-127) properly as characters
    For true Unicode characters, Go expects you to use rune
    byte is more accurately described as "8-bit value that can represent ASCII characters"

So the answer is: byte can represent ASCII characters, but Go doesn't consider it a true character type - that's what rune is for. byte is fundamentally a number type that happens to work well for ASCII text.

Can you create a gitignore appropriate to all of these languages?  I'm using .exe as executables without extensions are a pain.  Python
Go
Rust
C# (C Sharp)
C++
C

Fortran
Ada
Assembly
Edit

This comprehensive .gitignore covers all the languages you're working with:

Key highlights for your setup:

    Executables: Ignores *.exe files (perfect for your approach)
    Object files: *.o, *.obj for compiled languages
    Language-specific: Build directories, package files, temporary files
    IDE files: VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains, etc.
    OS files: Windows, macOS, Linux system files

For your specific programs, it will ignore:

    BasicConcepts.exe
    BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.exe
    PrintMaze.exe
    Any other .exe files you create

The structure is organized by:

    Each programming language section
    Editor/IDE files
    Operating system files
    Your custom executables

This should cover everything you need while keeping your repository clean of compiled binaries and temporary files across all these languages!

OK we setup a build for ada with the following command, but I want it to be HelloWorld.exe so I can gitignore executables: gnatmake HelloWorld.adb
Edit

To compile Ada programs with .exe extension, use the -o flag with gnatmake:

bash

gnatmake HelloWorld.adb -o HelloWorld.exe

For all your Ada programs:

bash

gnatmake BasicConcepts.adb -o BasicConcepts.exe
gnatmake BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.adb -o BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.exe
gnatmake PrintMaze.adb -o PrintMaze.exe

Or in a build script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
for file in *.adb; do
    name=$(basename "$file" .adb)
    gnatmake "$file" -o "$name.exe"
done

The -o flag:

    -o filename specifies the output executable name
    Without it, gnatmake HelloWorld.adb creates helloworld (lowercase, no extension)
    With it, you get exactly the name you want: HelloWorld.exe

This way your .gitignore will properly catch all the executables with the *.exe pattern, keeping your repository clean across all languages while maintaining consistent naming.

nasm command not found
Edit

To install NASM (Netwide Assembler) on Ubuntu:

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm

To verify installation:

bash

nasm -version

To compile assembly programs with NASM:

bash

# For 64-bit programs
nasm -f elf64 program.asm -o program.o
ld program.o -o program.exe

# For 32-bit programs  
nasm -f elf32 program.asm -o program.o
ld -m elf_i386 program.o -o program.exe

If you need other assemblers too:

bash

# GNU Assembler (gas) - part of binutils
sudo apt install binutils

# FASM (Flat Assembler)
sudo apt install fasm

# YASM (alternative to NASM)
sudo apt install yasm

For your build script, you might want:

bash

# Compile assembly to object file
nasm -f elf64 BasicConcepts.asm -o BasicConcepts.o
# Link to create executable
ld BasicConcepts.o -o BasicConcepts.exe

NASM is the most commonly used assembler for x86/x64 assembly programming and should handle most assembly code examples you'll be working with.

no required module provides package BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.go: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'
Edit

Go is looking for a module file. You have a few options to fix this:

Option 1: Initialize a Go module (recommended for projects):

bash

go mod init learn-programming

Then run:

bash

go run BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.go

Option 2: Run without modules (simpler for single files):

bash

GO111MODULE=off go run BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.go

Option 3: Set environment variable permanently:

bash

export GO111MODULE=off
go run BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.go

Option 4: Build directly (older Go versions):

bash

go build BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.go
./BasicConcepts_InvalidNames.exe

For your educational examples, I'd recommend Option 2 since you're working with simple, standalone files that don't need module management.

If you want to create a build script:

bash

#!/bin/bash
export GO111MODULE=off
for file in *.go; do
    name=$(basename "$file" .go)
    go build "$file" -o "$name.exe"
done

The module system was introduced in Go 1.11+ for dependency management, but for simple single-file programs like yours, disabling modules (GO111MODULE=off) is easier.

OK, can you create a version of these programs in Rust?
Edit

I'll create the Rust versions of these programs. Rust has some unique characteristics like ownership, strict type safety, and different error handling:

Perfect! I've created all the Rust programs. Here are the key Rust-specific characteristics shown:

Rust-specific behaviors:

    Memory safety: No uninitialized variables allowed (compile error)
    Strong typing: No implicit type conversions (compile errors)
    Shadowing: Variable redeclaration is allowed and creates new variable
    Explicit types: Uses i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64, f32, f64
    Unicode chars: char type is 4 bytes, handles Unicode properly
    Snake_case: Rust convention uses underscores instead of camelCase
    Keywords: fn, struct, let instead of function, class, etc.

Error types in Rust:

    Compile errors: Invalid syntax, undefined variables, type mismatches, uninitialized variables
    Runtime panics: Integer overflow (in debug mode), unwrap on None/Err
    Memory safety: Ownership system prevents many runtime errors

Key differences from other languages:

    No undefined behavior: Rust catches most issues at compile time
    Ownership system: Prevents memory leaks and data races
    Pattern matching: More sophisticated error handling
    Zero-cost abstractions: High-level features with minimal runtime cost

To compile Rust programs:

bash

rustc BasicConcepts.rs -o BasicConcepts.exe
rustc PrintMaze.rs -o PrintMaze.exe

The programs demonstrate how Rust's safety-first approach catches many programming errors at compile time that other languages might allow to become runtime issues.

What is the ! on println calls?
Edit

The ! indicates that println! is a macro, not a regular function in Rust.

What are macros?

    Macros are code that writes other code (metaprogramming)
    They're expanded at compile time before the regular compilation
    They can take a variable number of arguments
    They can do things that functions cannot

Why println! is a macro:

rust

// This works - variable number of arguments
println!("Hello");
println!("Hello {}", name);
println!("Hello {} {}", first, last);
println!("Numbers: {} {} {}", a, b, c);

// A regular function couldn't handle this flexibility

Other common Rust macros:

    vec! - creates vectors: vec![1, 2, 3]
    format! - string formatting: format!("Hello {}", name)
    panic! - crashes the program: panic!("Something went wrong")
    assert! - runtime assertions: assert!(x > 0)

The difference:

rust

// Macro call (note the !)
println!("Hello {}", name);

// Function call (no !)
some_function("Hello");

Why macros exist:

    Type safety: println! checks format strings at compile time
    Performance: No runtime overhead for formatting logic
    Flexibility: Can handle any number of arguments with type checking

So the ! is Rust's way of clearly distinguishing "this is a macro that does compile-time magic" from "this is a regular function call."

Is there a println that is not a macro?
Edit

No, there's no built-in println function in Rust. All the standard printing in Rust uses macros.

Why Rust uses macros for printing:

    Variable arguments: Functions can't easily handle variable numbers of arguments
    Compile-time format checking: Macros can verify format strings match arguments at compile time
    Type safety: Prevents runtime format string errors

If you want function-like behavior, you have alternatives:

1. Using print! with manual newline:

rust

print!("Hello\n");  // Still a macro, but closer to printf

2. Using lower-level functions:

rust

use std::io::{self, Write};

// Write to stdout directly (this is a function)
io::stdout().write_all(b"Hello\n").unwrap();

3. Using eprintln! for stderr:

rust

eprintln!("Error message");  // Still a macro

4. Custom wrapper function:

rust

fn my_println(s: &str) {
    println!("{}", s);  // Wraps the macro in a function
}

The underlying reality:

    println! eventually calls lower-level functions like write()
    But the convenient, formatted printing interface is always through macros
    This is a deliberate design choice for safety and performance

Other languages comparison:

    C: printf() is a function (with runtime format string vulnerabilities)
    Python: print() is a function
    Rust: println!() is a macro (compile-time safety)

So no, there's no direct println function - Rust intentionally uses macros for this to provide better safety guarantees.

OK, now can you make C# versions of these programs?
Edit

I'll create the C# versions of these programs. C# has some unique characteristics like strong typing, garbage collection, and different naming conventions:

Perfect! I've created all the C# programs. Here are the key C#-specific characteristics:

C#-specific behaviors:

    Strong typing: No implicit conversions between incompatible types
    No uninitialized variables: Local variables must be initialized before use (compile error)
    Garbage collection: Automatic memory management
    Case sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive
    UTF-16 chars: char type is 2 bytes, handles Unicode
    Explicit casting: Need (int)charOne to convert char to int

C# type system:

    sbyte/byte (8-bit signed/unsigned)
    short/ushort (16-bit signed/unsigned)
    int/uint (32-bit signed/unsigned)
    long/ulong (64-bit signed/unsigned)
    float/double (32/64-bit floating point)
    bool (true/false only)
    char (UTF-16 character)

Format specifiers:

    {0}, {1}, etc. for positional arguments
    {0:F17} for 17 decimal places
    {0:E} for scientific notation

C# keywords used:

    class, namespace instead of private, package

Error types:

    Compile errors: Invalid syntax, undefined variables, type mismatches, uninitialized variables, redeclarations
    Runtime exceptions: Overflow (in checked context), null references
    No undefined behavior: C# is memory-safe

To compile C# programs:

bash

csc BasicConcepts.cs /out:BasicConcepts.exe
csc PrintMaze.cs /out:PrintMaze.exe

Or with newer .NET:

bash

dotnet new console
dotnet run

The programs show how C# balances type safety with usability, catching most errors at compile time while providing clear error messages.

OK, now recreate these programs in Fortran?
Edit

I'll create the Fortran versions of these programs. Fortran has some unique characteristics like column-sensitive formatting, different variable declaration syntax, and case-insensitive keywords:

Perfect! I've created all the Fortran programs. Here are the key Fortran-specific characteristics:

Fortran-specific behaviors:

    Case insensitive: Keywords and variable names are case insensitive
    No unsigned types: Fortran doesn't have true unsigned integer types
    Kind system: Uses integer(kind=4), real(kind=8) for type specification
    Logical type: Uses .true. and .false. for booleans
    Character handling: character(len=1) for single characters, char() and ichar() for conversion
    Format specifiers: Uses write(*,*) for output, custom formats with write(*,'(...)')
    Implicit none: Forces explicit variable declaration

Fortran type system:

    logical - boolean (.true./.false.)
    integer(kind=n) - integers with specified byte size
    real(kind=n) - floating point with specified precision
    character(len=n) - character strings
    complex - complex numbers

Unique Fortran features:

    Program structure: program Name ... end program Name
    Kind parameters: 1.0_4 for single precision, 1.0_8 for double precision
    Intrinsic functions: huge(), tiny(), char(), ichar()
    No pointers/references: Different memory model than C++
    Array-oriented: Built for scientific computing

Fortran keywords used:

    program, end instead of class, namespace

Error types:

    Compile errors: Invalid syntax, undefined variables, type mismatches, redeclarations
    Runtime behavior: Uninitialized variables contain garbage (like C++)
    Overflow behavior: Depends on compiler flags

To compile Fortran programs:

bash

gfortran BasicConcepts.f90 -o BasicConcepts.exe
gfortran PrintMaze.f90 -o PrintMaze.exe

The programs demonstrate Fortran's scientific computing heritage with its kind system, intrinsic functions, and strong but different type system compared to other languages.

Error: Unexpected data declaration statement at (1)
Edit

The issue is with mixing declarations and executable statements in Fortran. All variable declarations must come before any executable statements (like write). Let me fix this:

Perfect! The issue was that Fortran requires all variable declarations to come before any executable statements. This is a key difference from languages like C++ where you can declare variables anywhere.

Fortran's structure rules:

    Program statement (program Name)
    Use statements (use module_name)
    Implicit statement (implicit none)
    All variable declarations (must be complete before any executable code)
    Executable statements (write, assignments, etc.)
    End statement (end program Name)

What I fixed:

    Moved all variable declarations to the top
    Put all write statements after all declarations
    This follows Fortran's strict "declaration section" then "execution section" rule

This is different from modern languages that allow you to declare variables anywhere in the code. Fortran's approach comes from its heritage as one of the earliest programming languages (1957) when this structure made compilation simpler.

The program should now compile successfully with gfortran BasicConcepts.f90 -o BasicConcepts.exe.

OK, moved all the declarations up, now I see:     ! Fortran character can handle values beyond ASCII range
    character(len=1) :: outOfRangeChar = char(65)  ! 'A' character
Edit

That error is because you can't use function calls like char(65) in variable initialization. In Fortran, initializers must be compile-time constants.

Fixed! The issue was that Fortran doesn't allow function calls in variable initialization. You can only use:

Allowed in initialization:

    Constants: = 5, = 'A', = .true.
    Simple expressions: = 1 + 2
    Intrinsic constants: = huge(1.0_4)

NOT allowed in initialization:

    Function calls: char(65), sin(0.5)
    Complex expressions involving functions

The solution:

    Declare the variables without initialization
    Assign values using function calls in executable statements

This is another example of Fortran's strict separation between compile-time (declaration) and runtime (execution) phases. The char() function needs to be called at runtime, so it must be in an assignment statement, not an initialization.

BasicConcepts.f90:21:48:
   21 |     integer(kind=4) :: minSigned32 = -2147483648
      |                                                1
Error: Integer too big for its kind at (1). This check can be disabled with the option ‘-fno-range-check’
Edit

The issue is that -2147483648 is interpreted as -(2147483648) where 2147483648 is too large for a 32-bit signed integer. Let me fix this:

The problem is similar to what we saw in C++. When Fortran sees -2147483648, it tries to:

    Parse 2147483648 as a positive integer
    Apply the minus sign

But 2147483648 is too large for a 32-bit signed integer (max is 2147483647).

The solution = -2147483647 - 1 works because:

    2147483647 is valid (it's the maximum positive value)
    -2147483647 is valid
    -2147483647 - 1 = -2147483648 (the minimum value)

This is the same issue we solved in C++ by using LLONG_MIN instead of the literal value. Fortran doesn't have predefined constants like INT32_MIN, so we use the arithmetic workaround.

Alternative approaches:

    Use the compiler flag: -fno-range-check (but this disables useful checking)
    Use the expression: -2147483647 - 1 (cleaner and safer)

The arithmetic expression approach is better because it's portable and doesn't disable compiler safety checks.
